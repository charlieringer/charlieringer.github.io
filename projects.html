				<h2>Current Projects:</h2>
				<p><strong>Monte</strong> - 'Monte: A general game playing AI Library for 2-Player Abstract games using Monte Carlo Tree Search and Deep Learning' is my final year project for my BSc. I am looking at how I can combine deep learning and MCTS in order to create AI that can play a wide range of games 'out-of-the-box'. Eventually Monte will be released as an open source Unity plugin. Everything is written by me in C#. </p>

				<h2>Past Projects:</h2>
				<p><strong>Code Noir</strong> - A collaborative project which blended puzzles with top down exploration. In Code Noir players took on the role of a spy in a cyber punk world. During game play player has to sneak past guards, hack computer terminals, pick locks and lift finger prints on their was to uncovering the secrets behind a company that were not all they seemed. Role: Lead Programmer, Lead Designer</p>
				<p><strong>Goro-Goro Dobutsu Shogi</strong> - This c++ implementation of the Japanese abstract game Goro-Goro Dobutsu Shogi used a Monte Carlo Tree Search opponent which provided solid opposition for players.</p>
				<p><strong>Leylines</strong> - Leylines was my first attempt at writing an intelligent opponent for a board game. It used a novel approach to the problem, using limited tree search combined with move selection inspired by genetic selection. Additionally the game itself is a game I designed (and still tinker with to this day). </p>

				<h2>Hackathons:</h2>
				<p><strong>Genetic Dungeon</strong> was a dungeon generator which used a combination of Genetic Algorithms and Monte Carlo simulations to build progressively more interesting Dungeons. Made in 24 hours at HackCity 2017 and winner of two awards, one for best AI hack.</p>
				<p><strong>Crime Watch</strong> was a Pebble watch app written in JavaScript which told the user how much crime was in the local area as well as potential hotspots to avoid. It used the Police data api as well as Mozilla's location API and was made in 24 hours at HackSussex 2016. Colab with <a href="http://amrishparmar.tk" style="color: purple;">Amrish Parmar</a>.</p>
