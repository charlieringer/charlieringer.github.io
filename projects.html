				<h2>Current Projects:</h2>
				<p><strong>Active research</strong> - I am currently engaged in a 12 week funded research project looking into conceptual blending and how this may be applied to video game design. Using the ideas of anaolgy based conceptual blending I am researching how we may be able to take two video games and blend the idea from each game together in order to make new and interesting games. </p>
				<p><strong>Leylines Redux</strong> - Using the very similar game design and theming to that which was used for the original Leylines game I am working on a second version in C++. This version is using the <a href="http://axilya.com>Axilya engine" style="color: purple;"">Axilya engine</a>. I am also using more complex and interesting AI techniques, with an MCTS agent that employees some of the improvements I developed for Monte. </p>

				<h2>Past Projects:</h2>
				<p><strong>Monte</strong> - 'Monte: A general game playing AI Library for 2-Player Abstract games using Monte Carlo Tree Search and Deep Learning' is my final year project for my BSc. I am looking at how I can combine deep learning and MCTS in order to create AI that can play a wide range of games 'out-of-the-box'. Eventually Monte will be released as an open source Unity plugin. Everything is written by me in C#. </p>
				<p><strong>Code Noir</strong> - A collaborative project which blended puzzles with top down exploration. In Code Noir players took on the role of a spy in a cyber punk world. During game play player has to sneak past guards, hack computer terminals, pick locks and lift finger prints on their was to uncovering the secrets behind a company that were not all they seemed. Role: Lead Programmer, Lead Designer</p>
				<p><strong>Goro-Goro Dobutsu Shogi</strong> - This c++ implementation of the Japanese abstract game Goro-Goro Dobutsu Shogi used a Monte Carlo Tree Search opponent which provided solid opposition for players.</p>
				<p><strong>Leylines</strong> - Leylines was my first attempt at writing an intelligent opponent for a board game. It used a novel approach to the problem, using limited tree search combined with move selection inspired by genetic selection. Additionally the game itself is a game I designed (and still tinker with to this day). </p>

				<h2>Hackathons:</h2>
				<p><strong>Travelling Playlist Problem</strong> is a CLI tool which uses the Spotify API to take a playlist, model it as a graph (with distance being how different songs are based on audio analysis) and then uses a genetic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem and, finding the shortest path reorganise the playlist so it flows better. Made in 24 hours at Anvil Hack 3 and winner of one of the Spotify awards for best use of their API.</p>
				<p><strong>Genetic Dungeon</strong> was a dungeon generator which used a combination of Genetic Algorithms and Monte Carlo simulations to build progressively more interesting Dungeons. Made in 24 hours at HackCity 2017 and winner of two awards, one for best AI hack.</p>
				<p><strong>Crime Watch</strong> was a Pebble watch app written in JavaScript which told the user how much crime was in the local area as well as potential hotspots to avoid. It used the Police data api as well as Mozilla's location API and was made in 24 hours at HackSussex 2016. Colab with <a href="http://amrishparmar.tk" style="color: purple;">Amrish Parmar</a>.</p>
