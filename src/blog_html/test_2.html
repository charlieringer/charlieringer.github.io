<p>The assositated dataset can be downloaded from:</p>
<p>Copy all files/folders found there into this directory</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>The data set needs to be convered into npy files first. This can be done with <code>utils/process_data_set.py</code>.</li>
<li>(optional) To apply the oversampling technique detailed in the paper run <code>augment_annotations.py</code> from the utils folder.</li>
<li>Once these preprocessing steps are complete <code>trainer.py</code> will run the full set of expeirments.</li>
</ul>
