				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<img src="images/profile.jpg" class="img-rounded profile_picture" alt="Profile image of me.">
				
				<p class="justify">I am a PhD student at Goldsmiths, University of London (but based in York), as part of the IGGI Doctoral Training Center (find out more <a href="iggi.org.uk">here</a>). I am currently active in AI and Machine Learning applications for Games research with a focus on the ways in which we can use Deep Learning to model various facets of video games streams (e.g. stream highlights, emotional moments, in-game events, various streamer behaviours etc.) with a focus on how to fuse multi-view stream data (e.g. audio, web-cam footage, game footage, chat) into a single model.</p>
				<h2>What do I do?</h2>
				<ul>
				<li> I solve problems using Machine Learning, especially focusing on Deep Learning and multi-view data. I do this using Keras and Python.
				<li> I explore and experiment with other approaches to Artificial Intelligence e.g. Video Game AI and Evolutionary Algorithms.
				<li> I design and make games, normally developing in Unity. I am espically interested games with a focus on novel AI and/or interactions with AI.
				<li> I enjoy giving talks and (informally) teaching people about Machine Learning and AI.
				</ul>

				<h2>Interested?</h2>
				<p>If you are interested in me or my work I would love to hear from you. I am interested in freelance work or consultancy as well as discussing ideas and collaborating on projects. Using one of the links below to get in touch.
