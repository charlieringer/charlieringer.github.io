				<h2>Welcome</h2>
				<img src="images/profile.jpg" class="img-rounded profile_picture" alt="Profile image of me.">
				<p class="justify">Greetings, I am a PhD student at Goldsmiths, University of London (but currently based in York), as part of the Intelligent Games and Game Intelligence (IGGI) Center for Doctoral Training, a £12m EPSRC funding CDT (find out more about IGGI at <a href="iggi.org.uk" rel="noopener">iggi.org.uk</a>). My research is currently focused AI and Machine Learning applications for Games research with a focus on the ways in which we can use Deep Learning to model various interesting facets of video games streams (e.g. stream highlights, emotional moments, in-game events, various streamer behaviours etc.) with a focus on how to fuse multi-view stream data (e.g. audio, web-cam footage, game footage, chat) into a single model.</p>
				<h2>Interested?</h2>
				<p>If you are interested in me or my work I would love to hear from you be it to answer any questions you have, work on a collaboration, or anything else you would like to know. Feel free to use one of the links below to get in touch.
