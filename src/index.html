				<h2>Welcome</h2>

				<p class="justify">Greetings, I am a PhD student at the University of York, as part of the Intelligent Games and Game Intelligence (IGGI) Center for Doctoral Training, a £12m EPSRC funding CDT (find out more about IGGI at <a href="iggi.org.uk" rel="noopener">iggi.org.uk</a>). My research is currently focused AI and Machine Learning applications for Games research with a focus on the ways in which we can use Deep Learning to model various interesting facets of video games streams (e.g. stream highlights, emotional moments, in-game events, various streamer behaviours etc.) with a focus on how to fuse multi-view stream data (e.g. audio, web-cam footage, game footage, chat) into a single model.</p>
